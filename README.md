Module Eight Journal Reflection

Project Summary:
This project involved designing and programming a prototype smart thermostat that can read temperature data, toggle heating and cooling states,
and communicate data over UART. The goal was to simulate a real-world embedded system that could later connect to a cloud-based analytics platform.

What I Did Well:
I did particularly well in structuring the code to be modular and readable. The state machine logic worked smoothly to transition between heating, cooling, 
and idle modes, and the LED indicators responded correctly to sensor input.

Where I Could Improve:
If I had more time, I would enhance the error-handling logic and include a cloud communication test module to simulate the next project phase. 
I would also explore more efficient power management and memory optimization.

Tools and Resources Added to My Network:
I strengthened my understanding of GPIOZero, smbus for I2C communication, and serial communication via UART. 
I also used documentation and forums (like Raspberry Pi and Stack Overflow) for debugging and troubleshooting.

Transferable Skills:
This project improved my skills in embedded programming, sensor integration, and modular code design—all applicable to robotics, IoT, and real-time systems development.

Maintaining, Reading, and Adapting:
I kept the code clean and commented, used clear variable naming, and structured functions logically. Each component—sensors, LEDs, UART, and state machine—was modular, 
so future developers can replace or expand functions easily.
